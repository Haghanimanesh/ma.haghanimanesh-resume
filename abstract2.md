Hot-rolled strips are cooled on the run-out table to achieve the customer-required mechanical properties. Cooling reduces 
the oxidation, which can assist the coiling operation. The ability to obtain a range of mechanical properties from a single steel grade reduces the use of alloying elements (elements added to a metal or an alloy which are incorporated in the 
metallic structure and change in the properties of the basic alloy) and the size of the slab inventories. So in this paper, the 
high-temperature steel strip cooling pattern with the temperature of 870 °C and reaching the temperature of 630 °C using 
water and air is studied. Moreover, the numerical simulation of the high-temperature strip cooling and its cooling method is 
carried out. The results are compared with the similar sampler ones. The changes of three key parameters such as change in 
strip speed and its efect on cooling rate, change in pattern and arrangement of water showers and its efects and change in 
the cooling water temperature are investigated. It was found that the uniformity of the heat distribution inside the strip was 
increased, but the temperature of the strip was lower than the required temperature. The middle and up surface temperatures 
of the strip were performed at a speed of 3.48 (m s−1), which showed a very good match with the actual tested sample.  </p>

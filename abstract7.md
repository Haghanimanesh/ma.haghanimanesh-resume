  <p class="p1" align="justify">The purpose of this research is to investigate the amount of heat losses in box annealing furnaces in the cooling process of coils in the cold rolling unit. Then, different methods of dissipative heat recovery as well as their use were investigated. In this regard, two-fluid Jing, Goswami and organic Rankin cycles in two areas of heat losses in the furnace cooling process modeled and analysis by MATLAB and EES software, from the point of view of energy, exergy, exergy-economic and environmental exergy. One of the common ways to recover low and medium temperature dissipative heat is to use various types of organic Rankine power generation cycles as well as Kalina-based refrigeration and power generation cycles. To calculate the heat dissipation from the furnace, the coil temperature profile was used during the cooling process and the curve fitting method. Also, in waste heat recovery cycles from furnace cooling, latent heat storage tank considered for heat storage and three types of phase change materials (PCM) compared. NaNo2 with the highest phase change temperature had the best result in the storage tank. In the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle, in each section, three operating fluids in relation to the ethanol operating fluid examined separately as the first fluid of the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle. Exergy-economic results, environmental exergy and parametric analysis presented in the results section. Also, using the capability of EES software in the pressure and temperature range, single-objective and multivariate optimization was performed. The Jing cycle was selected as the best cycle with a unit cost of 6.725 ($/GJ) and the impact of the environmental unit 0.001072 (mPts/kJ) as well as a return on investment of 7.08 years in the heat recovery from furnace cooling.</p>

  <p class="p1" align="justify">Due to the increasing need for refrigeration and air conditioning systems and its nature to increase energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the use of ejector refrigeration systems seems to be a good solution to replace conventional compression refrigeration systems. The main problem of ejector refrigeration systems is their low performance. In these systems, the coefficient of performance depends directly on the performance of the ejector. One of the most important prerequisites for improving ejector performance is to perform an accurate and reliable numerical simulation to predict local and general components in the ejector.</p>
 <p class="p1" align="justify">In this research, the operation of a two-stage steam refrigeration cycle ejector for two-dimensional flow, with spatial symmetry, steady state and reception density investigated by computational fluid dynamics. The use of two-stage ejectors, in turn, increases the overall efficiency of the refrigeration cycle compared to single-stage ejectors. At the end of this study, the effective components in terms of optimizing a two-stage ejector are presented. In this study, different turbulence models for the geometry of two-stage ejectors were investigated. The results show that the Realizable k-Îµ model has the closest result to the numerical value of the reference article. The model is the best turbulence model obtained. The effect of condenser pressure on mass ratio was also investigated using this model. The result shows that as the condenser pressure increases, the mass ratio of the ejector decreases.</p>

  <p class="p1" align="justify">The aim of this study is to examine the analysis of waste heat recovery cycles used in box annealing furnaces during the cooling of coils in the cold rolling unit, specifically looking at cycles connected to phase change material storage tanks. The article focuses on three cycles: Jing cycle, Gosvami cycle, and dual-fluid ORC. One of the key findings of the research is the identification of the appropriate temperature and pressure range for these cycles based on the cooling process of the annealing furnace. As the Jing cycle and Gosvami cycle rely on temperature as their main input parameter, the researchers created 3D plots to visualize how changes in temperature affect both parameters.</p>

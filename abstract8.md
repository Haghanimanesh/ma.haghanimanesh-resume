  <p class="p1" align="justify">The purpose of this research is to investigate the amount of heat losses of exhaust gas in box annealing furnaces of the cold rolling unit. Then, different methods of dissipative heat recovery as well as their use were investigated. In line with this goal, the two-fluid organic Jing, Goswami and Rankin tricycles in the two areas of heat loss in heat loss of exhaust gases during the heating process, in terms of energy, exergy, exergy-economic and environmental exergy, are modeled by EES software. And has been examined. In the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle, in each section, three operating fluids in relation to the ethanol operating fluid are examined separately as the first fluid of the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle. Exergy-economic results, environmental exergy and parametric analysis are presented in the results section. Also, using the capability of EES software in the pressure and temperature range, single-objective and multivariate optimization has been done. In terms of waste heat recovery from furnace exhaust gases, from the point of view of return on investment, Jing cycle with 7.37 years as the best cycle and also from the point of view of lowest product unit cost and lowest environmental product impact, two-fluid organic Rankin cycle with operating fluid Ethanol and R227ea were selected at a cost per unit of product ($/GJ) of 50 and the environmental impact of the product (mPts/kJ) of 0.01712.

  <p class="p1" align="justify">Energy plays a major role in economic prosperity and technological competition of countries. The amount of energy consumed annually in the industrial sector in the world and in Iran is economically and environmentally very expensive. Therefore, recovery of waste heat in parts of the industry that have high potential for improvement, has a favorable effect on both economics and the environment. One of the common ways to recover low and medium temperature dissipative heat is to use different types of organic Rankine power generation cycles as well as Kalina-based refrigeration and power generation cycles. In this research, the main purpose was to know the potential of annealing furnaces in the cold rolling process in terms of heat loss in different parts and also the use and recovery of these wastes by the proposed solutions. In line with this goal, three cycles of Jing, Goswami and two-fluid organic Rankin in the furnace cooling process and exhaust gas losses from four perspectives of energy, exergy, exergy-economic and exergy-environmental seperately were mathematicaly modeled by MATLAB and EES software.To calculate the heat dissipation of annealing furnaces, coil temperature profiles were used during the cooling process and the curve fitting method. </p>

  <p class="p1" align="justify">Also, in heat recovery cycles from furnace cooling, a latent heat storage tank was considered. Comparing the three types of phase change materials in the operating temperature range of the storage tank charging fluid, NaNo2 due to its high phase change temperature compared to another two fluids was selected. In terms of temperature and operating pressure, all cycles are individually adapted to the conditions of heat recovery, furnace cooling, and heat recovery from exhaust gases. Also, in the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle, in each section, three operating fluids in relation to ethanol operating fluid as the first fluid of the two-fluid organic Rankine cycle were investigated. Exergy-economic, exergy-environmental and parametric analysis results are presented in the results section. Also, using the capability of EES software in the pressure and temperature range, single-objective and multivariate optimization were considered. The Jing cycle was selected as the best cycle with a unit cost of 6.725 ($ / GJ) and the impact of the environmental unit of the product of 0.001072 (mPts / kJ) as well as a pay back period of 7.08 years in the heat recovery section of the furnace cooling. In terms of heat recovery from furnace exhaust gases, from the point of view of pay back period, Jing cycle with 7.37 years as the best cycle and also from the point of view of the lowest cost per unit of product and the least impact of environmental product unit, two-fluid organic Rankin cycle with operating fluid Ethanol and R227ea were selected at a cost per unit of product 50 ($ / GJ)  and the environmental impact of the product 0.01712 (mPts / kJ). </p>

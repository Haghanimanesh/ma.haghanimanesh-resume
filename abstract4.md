  <p class="p1" align="justify">Todays, high consumption of energy and lack of fossil fuel carriers for reasons such as limited access and high pollution production, has highlighted the need to use renewable energy sources such as solar energy more than ever. One of the disadvantages of using solar energy is that this source is not available at all hours of the day, so one of the ways to meet the needs of consumers in non-sunny hours and during the night is to use a thermal energy storage system. The general process of this research is thermal modeling of heating, cooling and solar power of a zero energy building with TRNSYS and TRNBuild software and validated the results with some references. In this research, a parametric analysis did for some different types of collectors (three types of flat plate collectors, vacuum tube and parabolic). The results obtained in both the heating cycle and the cooling cycle indicate the superior efficiency and solar factor in parabolic collectors.
Also a very simple model of photovoltaic panels can supply electricity to the building with the reference specifications. The general result emphasizes the need to use seasonal tanks as well as tanks with hidden storage. Since all the models have the most radiation received in the warm season, which with proper storage can increase the total solar efficiency. The results for the Iranian climate also indicate that this region, especially cities such as Isfahan, has a high potential for the use of solar resources, which can have a high economic justification.
